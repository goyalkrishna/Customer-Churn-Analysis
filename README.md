# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis

This project analyzes **telecom customer churn** data to understand why customers leave and what factors contribute to retention. It uses Python libraries such as **Pandas**, **Seaborn**, and **Matplotlib** to visualize customer behavior and service usage patterns.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Customer churn — when customers stop using a service — is a major challenge for telecom companies.
This analysis explores how features like **InternetService**, **TechSupport**, **OnlineSecurity**, and others affect churn probability.

Key goals:

* Identify factors that increase customer churn.
* Visualize churn distribution across different service categories.
* Gain insights to improve customer retention strategies.
